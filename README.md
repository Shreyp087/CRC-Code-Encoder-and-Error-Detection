## Description
This Python application utilizes the PyQt5 library to create a graphical user interface for CRC encoding and error checking. It allows users to enter binary messages, divisors, and received messages and then performs CRC encoding and error detection.

### Features
- Encode binary messages using CRC codes
- Check for errors in received messages
- User-friendly interface for input and output

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have PyQt5 installed (`pip install PyQt5`).
3. Run the `CRC_Code_Encoder_Error_Detection.py` script to launch the application.
4. Enter the binary message, divisor, and received message in the respective input fields.
5. Click the "Encode" button to perform CRC encoding.
6. Click the "Check" button to check for errors in the received message.
7. The application will display the encoded message and whether errors were detected.
